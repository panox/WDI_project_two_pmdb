### what was a win

* Reverting to previous commits when too much experimentation happens and things do not work
* Incoporating Icons
* Putting the Review form inside the movie page
* Having the rating logic in my models

### what you've been struggling with

* Using the founation_and_overides.scss file and changing the values of the sass variables 
* Trying to match my mockups
* Getting foundation fonts to work on heroku
* Making heroku look like localhost

### what would you have done differently if you had to do it again 

* Have dryer code

### what you've learnt during the project

* Using Rails Generators
* Using MVC

* Admin system with device

### For the future
